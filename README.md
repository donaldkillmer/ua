uniapt.py is a python version of the legacy McAuto UNIAPT N/C interpreter

This interpreter system was written for many mini computers as well as unix/linux systems
The core program library for the system was written in UPL (Uniapt programming language)and 
	included full integer and floating point math, trig, 3D vector operations and a disk OS
Creative Software Systems of Fountain Valley, CA converted the standard system to C and ported
	the interpreter to multiple Unix systems including HP, Sun and DEC as well as MS Windows
